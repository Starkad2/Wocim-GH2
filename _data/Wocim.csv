In the 1930s, Lena Jordan became affiliated with the Arkansas Home and Hospital for Crippled Negro Children in Little Rock, AR. The hospital was the only charitable institution that cared for crippled black children and operated with a small budget. By 1936, in considerable financial troubles, Lena Jordan placed a mortgage on her own home to keep the hospital in operation. Subsequently, the institution was renamed the Lena Jordan Hospital by 1938. Her hospital was a twenty-bed facility equipped for general surgery, medical, and obstetric care. It was open to all black patients, regardless of their ability to pay. The physicians who made up her staff worked without pay and for charity. Notably, Lena Jordan created a program at her hospital to train new nurses. She provided the opportunity for young women to gain work experience at the hospital and obtain a practical nursing certificate for their service.
