Thank you for your interest in the accomplishments of Women of Color in the medical profession both in Arkansas and as well as Arkansians abroad.

It is the mission of the Historical Research Center to collect, preserve, and provide access to materials related to the history of UAMS and history of the health sciences in Arkansas.

As such, we seek additional materials for its collection as well as artifacts that will help us document and share the State's rich history as it pertains to medical science.

If you would like to contribute an image, document, or AV file to the Arkansas Women of Color in Medicine Project, please contact Geoffery Stark at (501) 686-7737 or at glstark@uams.edu.

If you have materials that you wish to donate to the Historical Research Center, please contact Tim Nutt at (501) 686-6735 or tgnutt@uams.edu.

We will be pleased to hear from you and are grateful for your patronage.
