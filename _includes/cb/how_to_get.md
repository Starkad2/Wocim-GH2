Thank you for your interest in the *Pioneers of Diversity: Arkansas Women of Color in Public Health and Medicine* project.

It is the mission of the Historical Research Center to collect, preserve, and provide access to materials related to the history of UAMS and history of the health sciences in Arkansas.

As such, we seek additional materials for its collection as well as artifacts that will help us document and share the State's rich history as it pertains to medical science.

We support engagement and partnerships with UAMS Campus, Arkansas repositories, and diverse communities.

The *Pioneers of Diversity: Arkansas Women of Color in Public Health and Medicine* database is an ongoing digital project. If you would like to contribute an image, document or audio/video file, please contact Geoffery Stark at (501) 686-7737 or at glstark@uams.edu.

If you have materials that you wish to donate to the Historical Research Center, please contact Tim Nutt at (501) 686-6735 or tgnutt@uams.edu.

We will be pleased to hear from you and are grateful for your patronage.
