## About the Collection
The Arkansas Women of Color in Medicine is an educational project to increase the visibility and representation of marginalized women in the field of medicine.

It is our goal that people can learn about the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and achievements of women of color in Arkansas and gain a better understanding of their role in the history of medicine.

We hope that the project encourages those who may feel underrepresented or disadvantaged in the medical field by relating both the challenges and triumphs women of color have encountered pursuing a medical profession.

Included are images, documents and linked videos of successful women who are either native to Arkansas or whose medical careers have significantly impacted communities within the state.

The Historic Research Center celebrates the accomplishments of women of color and seeks to bring awareness of their amazing medical careers to a wider community.
