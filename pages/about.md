## About the Collection
The Arkansas Women of Color in Medicine is an educational project to increase the visibility and representation of marginalized women of color in medicine, as well as to provide support and encouragement to those who may feel underrepresented or disadvantaged in the medical field. It is our goal that, through the project, people are able to learn about the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of women and gain a better understanding of the unique challenges they face in the medical field. We celebrate the accomplishments of women of color and seek to bring awareness of their amazing stories to a wider community.  Included are images, documents and linked videos of successful women who are either native to Arkansas or whose medical careers have significantly impacted communities within the state.
