## About the Collection
The focus of this project is to increase the visibility and representation of marginalized women of color in medicine, as well as to provide support and encouragement to those who may feel underrepresented or disadvantaged in the medical field. Through the project, people are able to learn about the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of medical professionals of color and gain a better understanding of the unique challenges they face in the medical field. We celebrate the accomplishments of women of color working within the medical profession and seek to bring awareness of their amazing stories to a wider community.  Included in our project are images, documents and linked videos of successful women who are either native to Arkansas or whose medical careers have significantly impacted communities within the state.
