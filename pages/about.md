## About the Collection

The goal of this project is to increase visibility and representation of Arkansas women of color in medicine, as well as to provide support and encouragement to those who may feel underrepresented or disadvantaged in the medical field.  Included are images, documents, video and profiles of successful women who are either Arkansas natives or have been medical practitioners in the State.
